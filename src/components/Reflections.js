            <h2>Ethics Reflection:</h2>
         </div>
         <div className="reflection-text">
            The purpose of having a code of ethics in any setting is to make sure that everyone involved in a process knows what is expected of them professionally to ensure everyone is practicing honest and professional methods. A code of ethics sets a standard for what morals should be followed and what is considered wrong in the eyes of others. In my own life, I make decisions in ethical situations by aiming to always put others first. This one rule I have is the easiest way for me to make sure I am always following the ethics which are expected of engineers, and of people in general. As long as I put others first, it is hard for me to also be greedy or have my priorities wrong.

	         One of the ethical issues we discussed in class involved the Ford Motor Company and the production of the Pinta. In this specific instance, Ford was known to have placed the priority of making profit over the priority of keeping passengers safe and designing a car which was safe enough to sell. They valued the money they would save from poor engineering and time savings over the safety of passengers who would ultimately be injured by a poor, rushed design. For the most part, my classmates and I all agreed on what was ethical and what ethics were ignored in each story.
            <br />
            <br />
	         Out of the six virtues, integrity, honesty, fidelity, charity, responsibility, and self-discipline, I believe the three most important in our case study are honesty, integrity, and responsibility. If the company would have been honest, they would have been open about the safety issues with the car, meaning it would not have been allowed to be released. Integrity also goes along with honesty. If they had integrity in the decisions they made, they most likely would not have put the value of profit over that of passenger safety. Finally, responsibility. If the engineers had been responsible about the decisions they made, they would have never released a car which they knew would put passengers in danger and would have taken responsibility in redesigning the car to make it safer. I think there are many other virtues which could apply, but ultimately they all relate to having ethical priorities, one of the five “P”s. I chose these three because they all have to do with putting the priority of others ahead of yourself, and I also believe that they apply in most situations.
            <br />
            <br />
	         A code of ethics is a valuable thing for anyone to follow if they wish to be successful and well regarded. A good code of ethics also means that you will have the best interest in mind when making decisions that will affect others.

         <div className="reflection-text">
            Since I started at Iowa State University, I have always had a constant focus on progressing my knowledge
            into new areas. Whether I chose a specific path myself, or was just following the Computer Engineering
            curriculum, I was always met with a wealth of knowledge and introduced to a diverse  and unique environment.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through classes I have chosen such as "Advanced Programming Techniques", I was introduced to a new community
            that I thoroughly enjoy being a part of. Classes such as "History of the British Empire" forced me to
            think critically about historical events and gave me an appreciation for learning outside of my 
            core curriculum.
            <br />
            <br />
            My courses in Embedded Systems have been some of the most challenging, yet also the most rewarding
            exprience I have ever had. From controlling a Roomba, to capturing/broadcasting radio frequencies
            to control a quadcopter, Embedded Systems has given me a chance to test the limits of my
            knowledge and ability to problem solve greater than anything before. It has also made an
            impression on my ability to work with others. Being a part of a group is an essential component
            of the class, where we are working together to solve problems, as well as produce a presentation
            for others to view our learning journey through labs. It was always encouraged for us to reach out
            to other students, TAs, and the instructor for direction, not necessarily to just receive the answer.
            We also had significant training in using technical documents.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of class, I was fortunate to be a member of undergraduate research for ARA, a wireless
            research program at Iowa State University. I was able to learn about new technologies, like
            OpenStack, and also contribute to a major project. I wholly enjoyed working with the other
            members and seeing how our work was able to positively influence others.
            <br />

            Some of my experiences outside of academics were playing club baseball and intramural softball.
            Through both of these, I connected with many other students and gained lasting friendships,
            which benefitted my performance in academics as well through study groups and more resources
            in general.
            <br />
            <br />
            My experience at Iowa State could be summarized as having constant opportunities to learn
            in nearly anything you could think of. Not only was I able to gain a lot of knowledge in my
            area of focus, but I was also able to experience other areas like history and architecture
            through electives.

            <h2>General Education Reflection:</h2>
         </div>
         <div className="reflection-text">
            Before starting at Iowa State University, I was eager to start my more technical coursework;
            however, all of my experiences with general electives were excellent. I chose to take "History of the British Empire" (HIST 327)
            and "History of the American City" (ARCH 321). I am very happy with the selections I made and believe that
            they have supplemented my main courses well.
            <br />
            <br />
            History of the American City gave an extensive look at the changing architecture of modern cities
            and where they got their influence. I learned about the biggest cities in America; what they were like,
            how they started, what challenges they faced, how they overcame their challenges and adapted, etc.
            While the architecture we were dealing with was related to large scale infrastructure and construction,
            it also applies to other areas. We learned about efficiencies and planning, an important aspect of many
            other courses in Computer Engineering, specifically Computer Organization. In this class, we designed a
            processor, dealing a lot with hardware architecture. The knowledge from "History of the American City"
            helped me consider different engineering decisions and relate them to other areas.
            <br />
            <br />
            History of the British Empire looked deeply at how the British Empire came to power, how they advanced,
            what challeneges they faced, and their impact on the rest of the world. How they affected the world is
            probably the most important aspect of the course since it has the most widespread impact, and can even
            be seen in our lives. I would relate what I learned in this class to engineering through ethics. We
            talked a lot about how the British Empire mistreated its colonies, and how the actions it made
            had little regard for the impact they had on their people and culture. In other engineering courses,
            we have discussed this same ethical issue in regards to technology and other innovations. I learned that
            even though something may be good for those who are behind the idea, the main focus should be on those who will
            be the most directly affected, therefore, a good code of ethics should be kept in mind when making decisions.
            <br />
            <br />
            These general electives were an important part of my learning experience at Iowa State University.
            Not only were they interesting courses on their own, they also supplemented my learning in other courses
            as well.
